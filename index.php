          <h3>FAQs</h3>
          <p>
          <b>How do I put together a good gift?</b>
          </p><div>This anon poster described it better than I ever could. See below:</div>
          <img src="tips.png">
          <p></p>
          
          <p>
          <b>Will I be sending and receiving from the same person?</b>
          </p><div>No, we will be doing a round robin match in which A sends to B, B sends to C, C sends to D, etc., until we reach Z who sends to A.</div>
          <p></p>

          <p>
          <b>Can I participate twice? I want to send two gifts and receive two in return.</b>
          </p><div>We are okay with people participating multiple times, although we request that you only sign up once per batch. We would also prefer that you send your first gift and provide proof before signing up for a second batch.</div><br>
          <div>Due to how our form works, you won't be able to fill out the form more than once. Email <a href="mailto:bigboss@sekretsanta.com">bigboss@sekretsanta.com</a> to sign up for a second batch. Thanks comrade!</div>
          <p></p>

          <p>
          <b>I already own / have already purchased some stuff I'd like to send, how can I get matched with someone who wants my stuff?</b>
          </p><div>In our gift exchange we allow people to submit wishlists of items they would like to receive. Much of the fun of the event comes from putting together an awesome gift based on your target's wishlist, while still adding your own twist (see "how do i put together a good gift?" above). If stuff you already have fits your target's wishlist, then by all means send it! That said, please do not sign up with a gift already planned out. Let the gift you send come together based on your target's wishlist.</div>
          <p></p>

          <p>
          <b>Okay, but I have some really awesome stuff I want to send to someone!</b>
          </p><div>If you really do have a cool idea for a gift based on stuff you already have (i.e. you aren't simply wanting to offload your old surplus) then email <a href="mailto:bigboss@sekretsanta.com">bigboss@sekretsanta.com</a> and we can try to match you with someone who will appreciate and treasure your gift. Please understand that matching based on a specific gift isn't always easy.</div>

          <h3>The Batches</h3>
          <p>We will be performing matching in four two-week "batches" this year.</p>
          <p>During each two-week period, we will collect signups, and then match participants to other participants within that two-week batch.</p>
          <a name="giftdeadlineanchor">
          <p>The matches for each batch will be sent out one day after the end of the two-week period.</p>
          <p>Anyone who is not able to be appropriately matched within their batch will be moved to the next batch.</p>
          </a><p><a name="giftdeadlineanchor">Please see the </a><a href="#" class="schedulelink">operation schedule</a> for details on the batch signup / match / gift deadline dates.</p>
          <p><b>After receiving your match, you will be expected to purchase, assemble and send your gift within the next two weeks!</b></p>
          <p>You will not be penalized for sending past the two-week mark, but please <a href="#" class="contactlink">contact us</a> and let us know if you have to send late.</p>
          <p>Promptly sending your gift (and providing proof) will earn you additional <a href="#" class="raffleticketlink">raffle tickets!</a></p>

          <p>If you miss this date, you can still sign up as a participant on the "Last Sleigh out of the North Pole".</p>
          <p>Because you will have a very short time to send your gift, you will be limited to signing up for the lowest two price tiers (the idea being that likely won't have sufficient time to assemble a more expensive gift).</p>

          <p>Relief volunteers may be asked to provide relief at or below the tier you signed for (for example, if you signed up for the $100 - $150 tier, then you may be asked to provide relief for another $100 - $150 tier member, or for a tier beneath that. You will not be asked to provide relief at a tier higher than that which you signed up for.</p>

          <p>All participants will receive one entry, more entries can be earned by being involved in the event. See below for details.</p>

          <h3>The Prizes</h3>
          <p>Prizes for the raffle are currently:</p>

              <p><b>Handmade Ammo Crate</b></p>
              <p>
                <a href="crate.jpg"><img src="crate.jpg"></a>
              </p>
              <p>Patterned after the wooden crates that 7.62x54r tins are stored in, this crate is handmade by Big Boss and is great for storing ammo, cleaning supplies, or anything else /k/ related.</p>
              <p>Note: pictured crate is from 2017, the 2018 model will look even better!</p>
            </li>

              <p><b>Kel-Tec PF-9</b></p>
              <p>
                <a href="pf9.jpg"><img src="pf9.jpg"></a>
              </p>
              <p>Yes, we are raffling a gun! This is the PF-9 model, also known as the Neighborhood Watcher. Lightly used, fewer than 300 rounds fired through it. This will be transferred via FFL to a winner legally allowed to receive it.</p>
              <p>This particular gun was gifted to Big Boss in the Sekret Santa 2017 event. After caring for it over the year, in the spirit of /k/ristmas I have decided to pass it forward to another lucky kommando. Perhaps this is the start of a tradition?</p>

              <p><b>European WW2 Survival Kit (Europe only)</b></p>
              <p>This kit will be built around a Norwegian surplus NBC protection suit, and is being donated by a very generous kommando! As our donor is a Eurofriend this kit will be raffled off to other European kommandos, who probably need it more than us Amerifags anyways. If you receive this you are obligated to do a STALKER challenge with it.</p>
              <p>More details and images to follow!</p>

              <p>This awesome piece of art was donated by a wonderfully generous kommando. The main body is a deactivated mortar shell, the blades and skids are stripper clipazines, and the armament consists of 7.62x39 rounds. I kind of wish I could keep this thing. Makes for an awesome decoration and/or children's toy.</p>

              <p>A very generous anonymous kommando has donated 20 custom-made Sekret Santa patches! This will make a great memento of the event, and I hear that santa /k/laus himself wears one of these on his shoulder. Each one will be raffled individually so a lot more kommandos will now get prizes. Thanks tons to the awesome person who donated this - he knows who he is.</p>
