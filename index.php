          <h3>FAQs</h3>
          <a name="faqanchor"></a>

          <p>
            <b>Why are we requiring you to ship within two weeks?</b>
          </p>
          <p>/k/ristmas is a busy time. In past events, the biggest reason we have seen people get grinched is because their santa put off buying the gift, got busy, forgot, or had something come up. It's not malicious, but it results in someone getting grinched nonetheless. This is particularly bad when it results in a participant waiting for several weeks or months, unsure if their gift will ever arrive.</p>
          <p>To this end, in 2019 we have implemented a strict two-week policy. <b>You must ship, and send proof of shipping to Big Boss, within two weeks of receiving your match. <span class="redtext">Failing to do this within the two week deadline will result in you being marked as a grinch.</b> The idea is to get your match their gift quickly, or failing that, to allow Se/k/ret Santa staff to quickly get a participant grinch relief, so they are not stuck in limbo.</p>
          <p>The majority of gifts in 2018 - even the intricate ones - were built and shipped within a two week period. I know you can do it komrade. Furthermore, Big Boss is a reasonable man. If you fear you won't be able to m ake the two-week deadline, <a href="#" class="contactlink">email me</a> as soon as possible.</p>
          <p></p>

          <p>
            <b>How do I put together a good gift?</b>
          </p>
          <div>This anon poster described it better than I ever could. See below:</div>
          <img src="images/tips.png">
          <p></p>
          
          <p>
            <b>Will I be sending and receiving from the same person?</b>
          </p>
          <div>No, we will be doing a round robin match in which A sends to B, B sends to C, C sends to D, etc., until we reach Z who sends to A.</div>
          <p></p>

          <p>
            <b>Can I participate twice? I want to send two gifts and receive two in return.</b>
          </p>
          <div>We are okay with people participating multiple times, although we request that you only sign up once per batch. We would also prefer that you send your first gift and provide proof before signing up for a second batch.</div>
          <br>
          <div>Due to how our form works, you won't be able to fill out the form more than once. Email <a href="mailto:bigboss@sekretsanta.com">bigboss@sekretsanta.com</a> to sign up for a second batch. Thanks comrade!</div>
          <p></p>

          <p>
            <b>I already own / have already purchased some stuff I'd like to send, how can I get matched with someone who wants my stuff?</b>
          </p>
          <div>In our gift exchange we allow people to submit wishlists of items they would like to receive. Much of the fun of the event comes from putting together an awesome gift based on your target's wishlist, while still adding your own twist (see "how do i put together a good gift?" above). If stuff you already have fits your target's wishlist, then by all means send it! That said, please do not sign up with a gift already planned out. Let the gift you send come together based on your target's wishlist.</div>
          <p></p>

          <p>
            <b>Okay, but I have some really awesome stuff I want to send to someone!</b>
          </p>
          <div>If you really do have a cool idea for a gift based on stuff you already have (i.e. you aren't simply wanting to offload your old surplus) then email <a href="mailto:bigboss@sekretsanta.com">bigboss@sekretsanta.com</a> and we can try to match you with someone who will appreciate and treasure your gift. Please understand that matching based on a specific gift isn't always easy.</div>

          <h3>Matching and Batches</h3>
          <div class="alert alert-secondary">
            <p><b>Major Points:</b></p>
            <p>We will have five batches this year.</p>
            <p>Each batch will have a <b>signup, gifting</b> and <b>grinch relief</b> phase.</p>
            <p>All batches will <b>require</b> that you <b>ship (and send proof) within two weeks.</b><b class="redtext"> Failure to do so will count as grinching!</b>
            <p>Grinch relief will be provided immediately at the conclusion of a batch, for anyone whose santa did not ship within two weeks.</p>
            <p>Some of the later batches will have restrictions on international shipping, or will require that you buy a gift online and ship it directly to your target.</p>
          </div>
          <p>We will be matching in <b>five batches</b> this year. Each batch will run roughly the same way, with some differences between them.</p>
          <p>The major components of each batch are as follows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Signup Phase:</b> a batch will begin with a signup phase, which will be a period of time in which signups for that batch are accepted. The first batch will have a <i>two week</i> signup phase, all subsequent batches will have a <i>one week</i> signup phase.
              <br /><br />
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Match Sendout:</b> after the signup phase closes, we will match all members of a batch in a <b>round-robin style</b> exchange system. Each member will receive a target. Participants will receive an email containing their target's address and wishlist.
              <br />
              If we are unable to match someone in a batch, we will move that person to the next batch.
              <br /><br />
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Gifting Phase:</b> after receiving match info, a participant will have <b>two weeks to assemble and ship a gift to their target.</b> For the 2019 exchange, sending on time is <b>required!</b> <b class="redtext">Failure to ship your gift within two weeks, or failure to send proof of shipping to Big Boss, will result in you being marked as a grinch - so please send promptly!</b>
              <br /><br />
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Grinch Relief Phase:</b> immediately following the gifting phase, we will be assigning grinch relief to all participants whose santas did not ship. Grinch relief volunteers are asked to ship their relief package <b>within one week.</b> In this way, all participants should receive a gift either within two weeks after matching from their santa, or within three weeks after matching from grinch relief.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Promptly sending your gift (and providing proof) and participating in grinch relief will earn you additional <a href="#" class="raffleticketlink">raffle tickets!</a></p>
          <p>To ensure each batch runs smoothly as the holidays approach, we will be implementing certain restrictions on later batches. There are two major types of restrictions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>International Matches:</b> we will be restricting international matches to the <b>first three batches.</b> Only in these first three batches will we allow "international matches" - that is, matches between two participants in two different geographic regions (e.g. US and Canada, US and EU, EU and Australia, etc.). 
              <br/>
              The final two batches will still accept signups from kommandos all over the world, but these participants will only be matched with other participants from the same geographic region.
              <br />
              This restriction is to ensure that all international pairings have sufficient time to ship their gift and have it arrive by December 25th.
              <br /><br />
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Online Direct Shipping:</b> certain batches will require certain participants to <b>purchase items online and ship directly to their match</b>, instead of the standard procedure of shipping it to yourself and then packageing it all together to send to your match. 
              <br />
              In general, this will be done for the <b>final batches</b> very close to December 25th. The idea here is to get the gift to your target as soon as possible and ensure they do not have an empty tree on Christmas day!
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>You will be informed whether either of these restrictions apply to you when we send your match email.</p>

          <p>We will also send out a signup sheet sometime during the event to solicit more volunteers.</p>
          <p>Relief volunteers may be asked to provide relief at or below the tier you signed for (for example, if you signed up for the $100 - $150 tier, then you may be asked to provide relief for another $100 - $150 tier member, or for a tier beneath that. You will not be asked to provide relief at a tier higher than that which you signed up for.</p>
          <b>All grinch relief volunteers who provide proof of sending a relief package will receive a large number of <a href="#" class="raffleticketlink">raffle entries!</a></b>
          <b>Volunteers will also receive a special patch, available only to our valued Grinch Relief /k/orps!</b>
